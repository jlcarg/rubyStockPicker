The Odin Project - Ruby course - Stock Picker Project

This is the third project from the Ruby course within The Odin Project's Full Stack Ruby on Rails Path. The objective of the project was to implement a method #stock_picker that takes as argument an array of stock prices, one for each hypothetical day. This method should return the best combination of which day to buy and which day to sell.

## Project Requirements

- It should return a pair of days representing the best day to buy and the best day to sell
- Days start at 0
- You need to buy before you can sell

## Practiced skills

* **Ruby foundational skills:**
    - Arrays
    - Hashes
    - Basic Enumerable Methods
    - Conditionals

## About The Odin Project

> The Odin Project is one of those "What I wish I had when I was learning" resources. Not everyone has access to a computer science education or the funds to attend an intensive coding school and neither of those is right for everyone anyway. This project is designed to fill in the gap for people who are trying to hack it on their own but still want a high quality education.
